# File
A small class for making it a little easier to load files using either SDL_RWops or stdio.h functionallity. It is cross platform
and ready to go. I have only test on linux thus far, but will be building on windows soon.

##Origin
This class came about while learning about game engine development and I decided I wanted to use it in my petcode projects lexer.
It continues to gain new features and functionality.

##Building
To build this library since there are two different parts stdio and SDL2's rwops if you have the SDL2 libraries setup
and ready to go you can just execute the build.sh file (linux only). It will create a library file and put it in the folder.

If you don't have SDL2 installed but still want to use the library refer execute the following
```bash
g++ -c src/lib/File.cpp -I./include -o File.o
ar rc lib/libFile.a File.o
```
Then to build the test file perform the following
```bash
g++ src/test/main.cpp -o test -I./include -I./lib -lFile
```

##Usage
when you include the file to use the SDL system you need to define FILE_SDL
```c++
#define FILE_SDL
#include "File.hpp"
```
For more information on usage see the documentation page https://github.com/mckinneyaa/File/wiki/Documentation 

##TO-DO
* ~~convert the comments into documentation~~
* create a more efficient build system
* add more features and functionality
